This project is based on the Llama-2, released by Meta, and it is the second generation of the Chinese LLaMA & Alpaca LLM project. We open-source Chinese LLaMA-2 (foundation model) and Alpaca-2 (instruction-following model). These models have been expanded and optimized with Chinese vocabulary beyond the original Llama-2. We used large-scale Chinese data for incremental pre-training, which further improved the fundamental semantic understanding of the Chinese language, resulting in a significant performance improvement compared to the first-generation models. The relevant models support a 4K context and can be expanded up to 18K+ using the NTK method.

**The main contents of this project include:**

- üöÄ New extended Chinese vocabulary beyond Llama-2, open-sourcing the Chinese LLaMA-2 and Alpaca-2 LLMs.
- üöÄ Open-sourced the pre-training and instruction finetuning (SFT) scripts for further tuning on user's data
- üöÄ Quickly deploy and experience the quantized LLMs on CPU/GPU of personal PC
- üöÄ Support for LLaMA ecosystems like [ü§ótransformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) etc.
- The currently open-source models are Chinese-LLaMA-2 (7B/13B) and Chinese-Alpaca-2 (7B/13B) (check our [first-gen project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) for more models).

## Introduction

This project launches the Chinese LLaMA-2 and Alpaca-2 models based on Llama-2. Compared to the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), the main features include:

**üìñ Optimized Chinese Vocabulary**

- In the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), we expanded Chinese words and characters for the first-generation Chinese LLaMA model (LLaMA: 49953, Alpaca: 49954) to improve the model's encoding and decoding efficiency of Chinese texts.
- In this project, we **redesigned the new vocabulary** (size: 55296) to further improve the coverage of Chinese words and characters. We also unified the LLaMA/Alpaca vocabulary to avoid problems due to mixed use.

**‚ö° Efficient FlashAttention-2**

- [FlashAttention-2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) is an implementation of efficient attention mechanisms, offering **faster speed and optimized memory usage** compared to its first-generation.
- When the context length is longer, using efficient attention technology is essential to prevent explosive growth in memory usage.

**üöÑ Adaptive Context Extension based on NTK**

- In the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), we implemented the [context extension based on NTK](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/pull/743), which can support longer contexts without further training the model.
- Based on the above, we further designed a **convenient adaptive empirical formula** that does not require manually setting corresponding hyperparameters for different context lengths.
- The models in this project natively support a 4K context, which can be extended to 12K with the above technology and up to 18K+ at the expense of some accuracy loss.

**ü§ñ Simplified Bilingual System Prompt**

- In the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), we use [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) template for our Chinese Alpaca models
- Through preliminary experiments, we found that the lengthy system prompt by Llama-2-Chat is not as effective as a simple one
- We use a very simple system prompt while keeping the Llama-2-Chat template to better adapt to relevant ecosystems

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> As the LoRA models cannot be used separately, they must be merged with the original Llama-2 to form a complete model for model inference, quantization, or further training. Please choose one of the following methods to merge these models.
>
> - [**Online Conversion**](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2/wiki/online_conversion_en): Colab users can use the notebook provided by this project for online conversion and model quantization
> - [**Manual Conversion**](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2/wiki/manual_conversion_en): Offline method of conversion, generating different formats of models for quantization or further fine-tuning

## Inference and Deployment

## System Performance

### Generation Performance Evaluation

In order to intuitively understand the generation performance of the model, this project has launched an online model arena platform imitating [Fastchat Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena), where you can browse and evaluate the quality of model responses. The arena platform provides evaluation indicators such as win rate and Elo score, and you can view the win rate of battles between two models. The question bank comes from [200 questions manually created in the first-generation project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/tree/main/examples/f16-p7b-p13b-33b), and additional questions added on this basis. Generated replies are subject to randomness and are influenced by decoding hyperparameters, random seeds, etc., so the related evaluations are not absolutely rigorous. The results are only for reference, and you are welcome to experience it yourself. Please see the [examples directory](./examples) for some generated examples.

The validation set contains 1.3K multiple-choice questions, and the test set contains 12.3K multiple-choice questions, covering 52 subjects. The type of questions is multiple-choice. The experimental results are presented in the format of "zero-shot / 5-shot". For C-Eval inference code, please refer to this project's [üìñGitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2/wiki/ceval_en).

### Quantization Evaluation

To understand the quality loss brought by quantization, taking Chinese-LLaMA-2-7B as an example, we report the model size, PPL, C-eval results under different quantization levels. PPL is calculated under 4K context, and we report zero-shot and 5-shot results on C-Eval valid set.

| Precision | Model Size |  PPL   |   C-Eval    |
| :-------- | :--------: | :----: | :---------: |
| FP16      |  12.9 GB   | 9.373  | 28.2 / 36.0 |
| 8-bitÈáèÂåñ |   6.8 GB   | 9.476  | 26.8 / 35.4 |
| 4-bitÈáèÂåñ |   3.7 GB   | 10.132 | 25.5 / 32.8 |

Specifically, the followings are the benchmark for different quantization methods in llama.cpp. The speed is presented with ms/tok. For details, see our [Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2/wiki/llamacpp_en#quantization-method-and-inference-speed).

## Training and Fine-tuning

Please refer to the corresponding Wiki for information on pre-training (Chinese LLaMA-2 training) and instruction fine-tuning (Chinese Alpaca-2 training).

- **Pre-training**: The code is adapted from [run_clm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py) in ü§ótransformers. For usage, see the [Pre-training Script Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2/wiki/pt_scripts_en).
- **Instruction Fine-tuning**: The code refers to the relevant parts of dataset handling in the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) project. For usage, see the [Instruction Fine-tuning Script Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2/wiki/sft_scripts_en).

## FAQ

Please make sure to check if there is a solution in the FAQ before raising an Issue.

```
Question 1: What is the difference between this project and the first-gen project?
Question 2: Can the model be commercialized?
Question 3: Do you accept third-party Pull Requests?
Question 4: Why not perform full pre-training but use LoRA instead?
Question 5: Does Llama-2 series support tools that support the first-gen LLaMA?
Question 6: Is Chinese-Alpaca-2 trained from Llama-2-Chat?
Question 7: Why does training with 24GB VRAM lead to an OOM error when fine-tuning chinese-alpaca-2-7b?

<details>
<summary><b>Limitation Statement</b></summary>

Although the models in this project have significantly improved Chinese understanding and generation capabilities compared to the original LLaMA and Alpaca, there are also the following limitations:

- It may produce unpredictable harmful content and content that does not conform to human preferences and values.
- Due to computing power and data issues, the training of the related models is not sufficient, and the Chinese understanding ability needs to be further improved.
- There is no online interactive demo available for now (Note: users can still deploy it locally themselves).
